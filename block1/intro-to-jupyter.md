Introduction to the Jupyter Notebook Environment
===


Jupyter is an open source project that provides a webapp interface for writing code and documents. Throughout this tutorial, we will be using a Jupyter Notebook environment for development. 

### Starting up your Jupyter Notebook Environment

To start up your Jupyter notebook, enter the following command on your command prompt:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a browser with your new Jupyter environment, and should appear similarly to this:

Once you open a notebook, you can write and run python code. To execute a line of code, press `shift + Enter`. 

### Starting a Terminal

To open a terminal for writing CLI commands, click 'New' in the upper right corner. After selecting 'Terminal', a linux terminal will open.
